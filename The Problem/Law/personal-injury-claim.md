# Personal Injury Claim

## Checklist
- Is there a duty of care (either common law or statutory)?
- Has there been a breach of that duty of care (i.e. has the person responsible acted objectively unreasonably?)?
- Has a reasonably foreseeable injury been caused as a result?
- Is it more likely than not that the claimant’s case is proved?

## Sentences
- In all cases of common law negligence – a claimant will need to show fault on the part of the defendant.
- A genuine accident – in which nobody was at fault – will not give rise to liability under the law of negligence.
- A prospective claimant is expected to comply with a ‘Pre-Action Protocol’, which requires steps to be taken to try to resolve the issue without formal legal proceedings.
- Unless you have legal insurance or particularly deep pockets, you are unlikely to be legally represented.
- The court at trial will hear evidence, including expert medical evidence, to determine whatever issues are in dispute, and make findings on liability and causation.
- You may have contributory negligence if the claimant has been careless in some way. This will reduce the compensation.
- The principle behind damages is to restore the claimant to the position that they would have been in had they not been harmed by these actions.
- Where there's blame, there's a claim.
- Organisations have adopted disproportionately risk-averse practices in response.
- A court is now required to dismiss the whole of a personal-injury claim if it is satisfied that a claimant has been ‘fundamentally dishonest’ in relation to the claim
- Legal costs can’t be recovered in small claims, so many people are forced to represent themselves.
- Three quarters of medical experts working in personal injury would not accept instructions from an unrepresented litigant.
