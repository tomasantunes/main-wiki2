My last entry was in May. We are now at the end of June. I made it through work. I had some problems on the off-times but I survived and yesterday I finally went to the doctor. I have a new medication and my process with the psychological problem is starting. I have a speech problem talking to people in real life where I have to start complaining at the things they say. Today there are no news. I'm waiting for feedback from my workmates and meanwhile I'm going to work on my to-do list and check stackoverflow.

I have a dentist appointment in two days even though my pain has disappeared. Still it's a good idea to go there. Today I'll have to buy lunch at the vending machine and after work I can't forget to go the supermarket.

I need to find some way to put my to-do list on the mobile phone.
