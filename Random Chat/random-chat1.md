<SeniorDev> Não faz mal, o cliente vai-se queixar que foi hackeado e nós vamos-lhe dizer que ele tem de pagar para resolver esse problema.
<SeniorDev> Não sei porquê, mas eu só tenho estes dois problemas da interface e és tu que tens de fazer e és tu que tens de me ligar.
<SeniorDev> Eu vou estar aí mais logo.
<JuniorDev> Eu estou à espera do WebDev, porque ele disse que ia estar comigo e depois trato disso.
<JuniorDev> LOL agora caiu-me em cima o outro projeto que vai demorar imenso tempo.
Break...
<Princess> Really, you're a servant? I'm not a servant.
<JuniorDev> Yeah. I was born this way, what can I do.
<Princess> Why can't you be a master?
<JuniorDev> No way. That's impossible. Everyone sees me as a servant and I like it that way.
<Princess> And are you happy like that?
<JuniorDev> Yes. I feel much happier this way.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I finished a project.
<Student> Finally... it's getting harder and harder these days.
Break...
<Manager> The problem is you don't know how to Google.
<JuniorDev> The problem is how to get information. It's not just just googling. I can start a page on that.
<JuniorDev> Did you know that young people don't use Google anymore, they use TikTok.
<Princess> Querias, querias.
<JuniorDev> I went to Google and it had photos of naked women. And they were high-quality, full HD.
