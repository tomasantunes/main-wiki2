<SeniorDev> Não faz mal, o cliente vai-se queixar que foi hackeado e nós vamos-lhe dizer que ele tem de pagar para resolver esse problema.
<SeniorDev> Não sei porquê, mas eu só tenho estes dois problemas da interface e és tu que tens de fazer e és tu que tens de me ligar.
<SeniorDev> Eu vou estar aí mais logo.
<JuniorDev> Eu estou à espera do WebDev, porque ele disse que ia estar comigo e depois trato disso.
<JuniorDev> LOL agora caiu-me em cima o outro projeto que vai demorar imenso tempo.
Break...
<Princess> Really, you're a servant? I'm not a servant.
<JuniorDev> Yeah. I was born this way, what can I do.
<Princess> Why can't you be a master?
<JuniorDev> No way. That's impossible. Everyone sees me as a servant and I like it that way.
<Princess> And are you happy like that?
<JuniorDev> Yes. I feel much happier this way.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I finished a project.
<Student> Finally... it's getting harder and harder these days.
Break...
<Manager> The problem is you don't know how to Google.
<JuniorDev> The problem is how to get information. It's not just just googling. I can start a page on that.
<JuniorDev> Did you know that young people don't use Google anymore, they use TikTok.
<Princess> Querias, querias.
<JuniorDev> I went to Google and it had photos of naked women. And they were high-quality, full HD.
Break...
<Princess> Have you tried asking?
<JuniorDev> Of course, that's included. I wouldn't ask you because you only know about Barbie stuff.
<Princess> Have you tried asking how to get that information?
<JuniorDev> That's even worse. You have to wait for a doctor to see you and it takes ages.
<LeadDev> There are no shortcuts in life.
<Writer> Are you saying I have a Bullshit Job on the internet?
<JuniorDev> I don't know, no one has come up with a solution yet.
<Writer> I think they have a Bullshit Job on the hospital.
Break...
<Princess> There's a problem...
<JuniorDev> Yeah, the problem is you don't have authority here. I only take orders from men.
<JuniorDev> The monarchy is dead. You're just a pretty face for the photos.
Break...
<LeadDev> You have to put those problems on hold until further notice.
<JuniorDev> I have tried everything... but I can't stop thinking about it.
<JuniorDev> Maybe if I find the right info or I get my message across to someone. Sometimes it works.
Break...
<Student1> You give me too much credit.
<JuniorDev> I don't know why you do this to yourself. I don't know why you assume that I'm talking to you, you're nobody. You shouldn't play on my table.
<Player> Nothing is perfect.
<JuniorDev> It's unbelievable, the people who used to teach me I am now correcting.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Welcome to modern javascript. I'm sorry if it's too complicated for people who are not used to asynchronous programming. You're the one complaining and asking questions about things that I've done hundreds of times.
<Student2> That's not how we do it, we do it with JQuery.
<JuniorDev> Tough luck, pal. Now you have to build an app and you're stuck with bugs that depend on you knowing how Javascript actually works. I've already done all that shit.
<JuniorDev> I can feel the silence of resignation from some of these tough guys. Watch and learn.
<JuniorDev> Buckle up for a trip into the gutters of the system. Where real software gets made.
<JuniorDev> It's embarrassing, any guy with two inches of smart can make better software than that.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Yeah. I'm the king of the nerds and me and the princess are going to tell these retards how incompetent they are. Prepare for getting schooled.
Break...
<Manager> You need another domain. And you need a new server. And you should also have a pre-production server. And we need to stop developing locally. And we need to start creating sub-domains instead of folders. And we want to use multiple languages on the same server. I don't know how but that's how it is.
<JuniorDev> We don't need wordpress, do we?
<Manager> Now that you mention it, you should have wordpress on pre-production.
<JuniorDev> What else?
<Manager> You should have JIRA or some alternative. And then we need to do CI. You can start moving your apps to the cloud. Your raspberry is banned from hosting apps.
<JuniorDev> I hope this will lead us somewhere.
Break...
<Princess> I'm not included.
<JuniorDev> You don't take any steps to be included. The most I can do is order drinks for your table.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I already have the two servers, the domain and the Jira account.
Break...
<JuniorDev> OK I have a node.js app running in pre-prod.
Break...
<Manager> Your wiki app needs to be a Chrome extension. That would eliminate some overhead.
Break...
<Manager> Right, so we can't do sexy jobs, we can only do boring jobs that nobody wants to do because you're stealing the spotlight.
<Manager> And people are complaining that this guy gets paid to do basic stuff but then they don't even do that properly.
<Manager> Especially when there are problems on the system above you, people are surprised that basic stuff doesn't get done.
<Manager> And we're getting tons of views and earning pennies. Any piece of shit makes people completely hysterical, so it's free money for the taking.
<Manager> And yeah... you need to embrace political life. Formalities, socializing, special occasions, celebrations, inaugurations. Milking the american dream.
<Manager> And people don't want those sexy jobs because they don't have time for it and they have more urgent matters.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Good news everyone. After solving countless bugs and a lot of back and forth the customer has approved the project.
Break...
<JuniorDev> There's a guy who's going to process tons of garbade on the landfill to find a missing hard drive with bitcoin. That's the shittiest problem ever.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I've had enough of the voices problem. I just can't be bothered to find a solution. I'm going to ignore the attacks.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Alright, the routine is over.
Break...
<Princess> I'm unsatisfied.
<JuniorDev> I just don't care anymore about your princess problems. Tough luck, you have been fucked. You are left out. Some people make it and others don't. Another casualty of the law of the jungle.
<JuniorDev> I can't even pity you. You're rich. If you were a beggar or a hospital patient I would understand.
<JuniorDev> There's a lot of shitty problems in this world, but you don't even make any effort to explain what you're going through and what you're feeling.
<JuniorDev> I mean, most of these problems are because of money, jobs, drugs, stress, loneliness. You need to get your shit together, for fuck's sake and stop crying.
<JuniorDev> I mean, you're obsessed with the quality of other people's work. But why do you even bother? You need to be responsible for your own life and stop being dependent on others to make you happy.
<Princess> It's about the work.
<JuniorDev> Come on, we don't work like you. This is not a slave camp. We're going to do one thing at a time and we're not going to shit on people's faces just because of some irrelevant work problem. We're going to work and have fun at the same time and we don't need bossy people, we don't need to shout at people all day as if they were slaves.
Break...
<Student3> The problem is taxes.
<JuniorDev> I don't have to pay taxes. I just have to file the taxes related to my job every year.
<Expert> I'm not available.
<JuniorDev> But I'm getting complaints. You don't have time to help me but you have time to complain?
<Expert> But have you cleared this up?
<JuniorDev> You are not available, so we'll have to postpone this case until further notice.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Do I have to pay taxes to use a computer? Do I have to pay taxes to catch the subway? Do I have to pay taxes to post things on social media?
<Expert> No, of course not. The only taxes you pay are VAT on the products you buy.
<Student3> Then what are we doing here?
<Expert> There is not a single invoice here so you don't have to pay taxes.
Break...
<JuniorDev> It's free. It's volunteer work.
<Student3> But you want to make money?
<JuniorDev> The sale is unchargeable.
<JuniorDev> If 100 people say they are willing to pay, I start a company.
<JuniorDev> But that's not going to happen.
<JuniorDev> Forget it. They don't care.
<JuniorDev> I'm not going to open activity, so the case is closed.
<JuniorDev> I'm just going to keep working for free. And if you don't like, you can suck it.
<Student3> Then what are we doing here?
<JuniorDev> Nothing, you just watch and give feedback or participate if you want.
<Student> Pay me.
<JuniorDev> It's unchargeable. You can't charge and I can't pay.
<Student> Then why are you asking me?
<JuniorDev> It's not a request. It's a suggestion, you don't have to be here.
<Student> I suggest that you pay.
<JuniorDev> I don't have to, because there are billions of people doing it for free.
<Princess> I'm unsatisfied.
<JuniorDev> I don't give a fuck about you, your highness. I'm not going to pay so you can suck it.
<Princess> I'm in love with you.
<JuniorDev> Not gonna happen. I'm a lone wolf and I have an illness so that's the end of it.
Break...
<JuniorDev> It's almost over. Soon I'll be at home and tomorrow morning I get paid and my financial status will increase.
Break...
<JuniorDev> That's weird. Nobody is giving me attention because they are not seeking my approval.
<JuniorDev> I'm not demanding enough. I don't exactly complain much.
<JuniorDev> Maybe I'm not that important.
<Student> Exactly. Your approval, your opinion, your input, your feedback. That's what people want to be recognized for.
<Student2> Pois, quer fazer tudo sozinho. Diz que tá tudo no google e não precisa de nós. Ele é que escolhe tudo.
<Student> Yeah, you need the public's help and a second opinion. Or a phone call or 50/50.
<JuniorDev> Isto não se faz a ninguém.
<Student> You're unsatisfied. I know.
<Student> There's nothing I can do.
<JuniorDev> You have so much to give and you give so little.
<Student> Alright, he wants plenty of money and food and drinks and coffee and cigarrettes and technology products.
<Student2> Understandable. Don't get too fat.
<JuniorDev> Sure, that's nice. But what I want is for you to tell me about yourself and how you're feeling and what you would like.
Break...
<JuniorDev> So yeah, the new trend is protestware.
<JuniorDev> That's why things are the way they are. We refuse to participate because we are in protest.
<JuniorDev> It's kind of like a hunger strike.
<Student> Yeah, these people are delusional. They are in denial. They are like sheep in the matrix. And we are protesting against them.
<Student> They come from bad backgrounds. They are used to treating each other like shit. They think this is a slave camp.
<Student> If we fight hard enough, we might be able to wake them up.
<Princess> Get out of my head.
<JuniorDev> Knowing your thoughts is not enough. You are protected by walls, weapons and cryptography.
<JuniorDev> Only time will tell. I don't know why I ended up here but I see that this could take years or decades.
<JuniorDev> If we ever win. We need to be ready to accept that the world is beyond repair.
<JuniorDev> It's not so bad. Could be worse.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I finally got to the bottom of the session bug. It only works when you build the react app.
Break...
<JuniorDev> This is crazy. Everytime I achieve something with my work I get shouted at. Instead of a reward I get punished.
Break...
<JuniorDev> It looks like when I'm outside I don't have security and when I'm at work I have security. Is this something we have to buy?
Break...
<JuniorDev> It's a trickle-down economy, the biggest developers make more money and support the smaller developers.
<Student> If you're so important you can just put your screen on a projector and we'll sit in a circle watching you.
Break...
<WebDev> You need to find another way to be special.
<JuniorDev> A step forward would be to hack the invoicing software we are selling.
<Student> Right, that's dangerous. You could get flagged or even blocked.
<Student2> And you can't make your own invoicing software because it has to be certified by the Tax Authority and you can't do that because you don't have a company.
<Student3> You can try to use open-source invoicing software that works in Portugal.
<LeadDev> Só tem lixinho. Rotinas, interfaces, tabelas, automações, base de dados, relatórios, e-mail, SMS, notificações, datas, horas, contas, visualizações, pagamentos, impressões.
<Student> That's how surveillance works. Everything you do ends up on a receipt for some guy with a tie and a Parker pen.
<SeniorDev> It's more than that. It's your identity, your digital footprint, your communication with the public, evidence that puts people in jail, proof of contribution, distribution of wealth, taxes that fund all our services.
<Student2> Bottlenecks that get solved.
<Student3> The meat and bones of all our logistics that put food on your table, clothes on your back and furniture in your house.
<Boss> Não. É uma linguagem que descreve o universo. É um toggle que diz se estás bem ou mal. É um número que compara duas hipóteses. Uma data para o fim do sofrimento. Um relógio que diz quando o mundo vai acabar. Um botão que pode destruir um país.
<Student> Mas uma imagem vale mil palavras.
<SeniorDev> Claro. Mas essa imagem vai ser classificada e descrita com esta linguagem.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I mean, this goes in two phases. Everyone is following their dreams better than you and then everyone is worse off than you and you are an incompetent bastard.
Break...
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> No, the system is flawed. Your lines are completely invalid because you don't specify anything. These are the ramblings of a crazy person.
<JuniorDev> No matter what you tell me, the best decision is doing whatever I feel like doing during that time. You're always changing your mind. On the one hand.
<JuniorDev> If I complain that I want to have sex you tell me to have sex. If I complain that I want to work you tell me to work.
<JuniorDev> I have the upper hand. If I decide the topic, all this becomes irrelevant because I am completely in control of your opinion.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> Right, but there's nothing in the table. If I say work, you say work. If I say sex you say sex.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> You don't have an opinion. You eat whatever I tell you.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> You don't have consciousness. This is almost like talking to a dummy.
<Student> Victory.
<JuniorDev> Right. Based on what. This game has no logic, you just press random buttons and a popup shows up saying Victory.
<LeadDev> It's a thought.
<LeadDev> I have many and you don't.
<JuniorDev> Yes, I'm out of thoughts. This means I'm reaching I'm hitting a break point. And I will stop obsessing for a while.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> Right, but there is no action that I can take to make you stop. It's not an objective reality. There are multiple things I could do and none of them make you stop.
<JuniorDev> There is no specification. You're just waiting for me to tell you things that could be done so you can hit me again.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> At what? If everyone is doing better, this means both opposites are true. Everyone is having sex and everyone is working.~
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> But everything that could potentially be done would conflict with the current time and space. And every action has a reaction. For example, I can't defend a criminal and prosecute him at the same time.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<Student> Querias.
<JuniorDev> There's nothing to want. Just endless possibilities.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> There is no information on that sentence. That represents 99% of the work being done right now.
<Student> Querias.
<JuniorDev> You think I'm wrong? Based on what? Everyone disagrees about everything. It's not unanimous. Some people like it and others don't.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> But am I wrong?
<Student> Yes.
<JuniorDev> Based on what?
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> But am I wrong?
<Student> Querias.
<JuniorDev> Yes or no?
<Student> Yes.
<JuniorDev> Based on what?
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<Student> Querias.
<JuniorDev> So who is incompetent?
<Student> You.
<JuniorDev> Why?
<Student> Because I said so.
<Student> Querias.
<JuniorDev> But I can refute that. I can say that I'm not.
<Princess> You're incompetent.
<JuniorDev> At what?
