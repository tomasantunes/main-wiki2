<SeniorDev> Não faz mal, o cliente vai-se queixar que foi hackeado e nós vamos-lhe dizer que ele tem de pagar para resolver esse problema.
<SeniorDev> Não sei porquê, mas eu só tenho estes dois problemas da interface e és tu que tens de fazer e és tu que tens de me ligar.
<SeniorDev> Eu vou estar aí mais logo.
<JuniorDev> Eu estou à espera do WebDev, porque ele disse que ia estar comigo e depois trato disso.
<JuniorDev> LOL agora caiu-me em cima o outro projeto que vai demorar imenso tempo.
Break...
<Princess> Really, you're a servant? I'm not a servant.
<JuniorDev> Yeah. I was born this way, what can I do.
<Princess> Why can't you be a master?
<JuniorDev> No way. That's impossible. Everyone sees me as a servant and I like it that way.
<Princess> And are you happy like that?
<JuniorDev> Yes. I feel much happier this way.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I finished a project.
<Student> Finally... it's getting harder and harder these days.
Break...
<Manager> The problem is you don't know how to Google.
<JuniorDev> The problem is how to get information. It's not just just googling. I can start a page on that.
<JuniorDev> Did you know that young people don't use Google anymore, they use TikTok.
<Princess> Querias, querias.
<JuniorDev> I went to Google and it had photos of naked women. And they were high-quality, full HD.
Break...
<Princess> Have you tried asking?
<JuniorDev> Of course, that's included. I wouldn't ask you because you only know about Barbie stuff.
<Princess> Have you tried asking how to get that information?
<JuniorDev> That's even worse. You have to wait for a doctor to see you and it takes ages.
<LeadDev> There are no shortcuts in life.
<Writer> Are you saying I have a Bullshit Job on the internet?
<JuniorDev> I don't know, no one has come up with a solution yet.
<Writer> I think they have a Bullshit Job on the hospital.
Break...
<Princess> There's a problem...
<JuniorDev> Yeah, the problem is you don't have authority here. I only take orders from men.
<JuniorDev> The monarchy is dead. You're just a pretty face for the photos.
Break...
<LeadDev> You have to put those problems on hold until further notice.
<JuniorDev> I have tried everything... but I can't stop thinking about it.
<JuniorDev> Maybe if I find the right info or I get my message across to someone. Sometimes it works.
Break...
<Student1> You give me too much credit.
<JuniorDev> I don't know why you do this to yourself. I don't know why you assume that I'm talking to you, you're nobody. You shouldn't play on my table.
<Player> Nothing is perfect.
<JuniorDev> It's unbelievable, the people who used to teach me I am now correcting.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Welcome to modern javascript. I'm sorry if it's too complicated for people who are not used to asynchronous programming. You're the one complaining and asking questions about things that I've done hundreds of times.
<Student2> That's not how we do it, we do it with JQuery.
<JuniorDev> Tough luck, pal. Now you have to build an app and you're stuck with bugs that depend on you knowing how Javascript actually works. I've already done all that shit.
<JuniorDev> I can feel the silence of resignation from some of these tough guys. Watch and learn.
<JuniorDev> Buckle up for a trip into the gutters of the system. Where real software gets made.
<JuniorDev> It's embarrassing, any guy with two inches of smart can make better software than that.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Yeah. I'm the king of the nerds and me and the princess are going to tell these retards how incompetent they are. Prepare for getting schooled.
Break...
<Manager> You need another domain. And you need a new server. And you should also have a pre-production server. And we need to stop developing locally. And we need to start creating sub-domains instead of folders. And we want to use multiple languages on the same server. I don't know how but that's how it is.
<JuniorDev> We don't need wordpress, do we?
<Manager> Now that you mention it, you should have wordpress on pre-production.
<JuniorDev> What else?
<Manager> You should have JIRA or some alternative. And then we need to do CI. You can start moving your apps to the cloud. Your raspberry is banned from hosting apps.
<JuniorDev> I hope this will lead us somewhere.
Break...
<Princess> I'm not included.
<JuniorDev> You don't take any steps to be included. The most I can do is order drinks for your table.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I already have the two servers, the domain and the Jira account.
Break...
<JuniorDev> OK I have a node.js app running in pre-prod.
Break...
<Manager> Your wiki app needs to be a Chrome extension. That would eliminate some overhead.
Break...
<Manager> Right, so we can't do sexy jobs, we can only do boring jobs that nobody wants to do because you're stealing the spotlight.
<Manager> And people are complaining that this guy gets paid to do basic stuff but then they don't even do that properly.
<Manager> Especially when there are problems on the system above you, people are surprised that basic stuff doesn't get done.
<Manager> And we're getting tons of views and earning pennies. Any piece of shit makes people completely hysterical, so it's free money for the taking.
<Manager> And yeah... you need to embrace political life. Formalities, socializing, special occasions, celebrations, inaugurations. Milking the american dream.
<Manager> And people don't want those sexy jobs because they don't have time for it and they have more urgent matters.
Break...
<JuniorDev> Good news everyone. After solving countless bugs and a lot of back and forth the customer has approved the project.
Break...
<JuniorDev> There's a guy who's going to process tons of garbade on the landfill to find a missing hard drive with bitcoin. That's the shittiest problem ever.
Break...
<JuniorDev> I've had enough of the voices problem. I just can't be bothered to find a solution. I'm going to ignore the attacks.
